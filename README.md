# JSP-Java-Servlets-Assignment-2
In this assignment I was required to have server-side validation for a form as well as import information from a .txt file and be able to edit a .txt file from a form on a JSP page. This is a pair programming
assignment but keep in mind I was the driver writing all the code for the project.
